##Spring Boot Exercise 403
The application has 3 pages: 
    * a course page, 
    * a teacher page and 
    * a student page. 
The Application also creates 3 users: 
    * one withADMIN role, 
    * one with USER role and 
    * one with both. 
The permissions on the security is that only people with the admin role can see the teacher page 
and only people with the user role can see the student page.

Thank you!
